Sure, it's not an all-time classic -there's probably a limit to how good a 'Rock' film' is going to be given his limited acting ability but he's surrounded by a great cast here- Billy Crystal, who should have got more screen time than Stephen Merchant ( who while fine in this -and a better actor than his mate, Ricky Gervase -is probably a bit too acquired a taste for your average child), Julie Andrews and Ashley Judd. It's not without its share of cheesiness but the imaginative fairy-related sequences definitely make this worth seeing for kids and adults with a bit of kid in them still.",

      "text": "Tooth Fairy proves Dwayne Johnson will do just about anything to try and get a laugh. Don a pink tutu? No problem. Put on a pair of fairy wings and act like you're six inches tall? He's down with that also. Johnson used to be an action movie stud, but now it's all about entertaining the kiddies. Does Tooth Fairy accomplish that? Yes. Kids will most likely get a kick out of Johnson's antics in this family friendly comedy with a message. And speaking of that message...Yes, it's great to have dreams and believe in yourself  and fairies. But a sledgehammer's used to pound home these themes to the point where adults may say enough already before Tooth Fairy's halfway over. Watching Tooth Fairy isn't as painful as having dental work performed (the title begs the comparison), but it's still not an experience adults need to sit through unless they're really into Dwayne Johnson, fairies, or have to take a kid to the movies. A scattering of smart jokes are lost amid a silly story in this predictable, campy comedy. Johnson stars as a former big league now fading minor league hockey player affectionately known as The Tooth Fairy. Why? Come on, do you really need to ask? It's because he hits people so hard their teeth fly out of their mouths. And this is encouraged and applauded in his hockey league. Derek's over the hill and on the downside of his hockey career, and the young stud on the team reminds him of that fact at every turn. This is a silly part of the storyline, so pay no attention to it. More important to note is that Derek has no problem shattering kids' dreams. When he almost tells his girlfriend's young daughter there is no tooth fairy, he's quickly shushed and then chastised. His tactlessness, and his penchant for bringing youngsters down, earns him a summons to Fairy Land. Fairy Land is ruled over by Julie Andrews. I don't think she's playing a character; I believe Andrews is in fact the queen of Fairy Land. She looks perfect in her wings and fairy costume. Derek's punishment for discouraging dreaming, and for stealing the money left by the 'tooth fairy' under his girlfriend's daughter's pillow in order to play poker (because $1 is going to go really far in a poker game), is to serve as the tooth fairy. For two weeks Derek's at the beck and call of his mentor, Tracy (Stephen Merchant), and those two weeks are pure hell for Derek. Equipped with fairy dust, amnesia powder, cat repellent, shrinking cream and a spray that makes him invisible, Derek has to go wherever he's called to pick up a tooth. And he has to go quickly since as soon as he's paged, he sprouts wings. And even though his nickname's The Tooth Fairy, hockey fans just wouldn't be into a 6' something hockey ruffian with gossamer wings.",

I write them in release order and sometimes happen to find grammatical errors that need fixing) Well, as 2009 ends off on a whimper, 2010 begins with an even worse whimper. That's right, I'm talking about \"Tooth Fairy,\" the unfunny, poorly-written, extremely dull and boring film about Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson playing...well, the Tooth Fairy. If that last sentence was any indication, the film sucked, and I can't even talk about the compact run time as a positive, since the film is roughly 100 minutes, and it feels like it. This film drags along, failing to land any truly memorable jokes at all. If anything, Dwayne Johnson gives it his all with the film and saves it from being one of the worst ever, but all told, \"Tooth Fairy\" is a weak theatrical film that everyone would be better off avoiding.",
