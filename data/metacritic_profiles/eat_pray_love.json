      "text": "\"Eat Pray Love\" would be easier to mock if author Elizabeth Gilbert wasn't a National Book Award nominee(for \"The Last American Man\"), and had both her fiction and non-fiction works cited by The New York Times as being \"notable\". So if you're going to be a hater, categorically labeling the memoirist as being narcissistic, the latest offender of the \"me\" lit boom, heed her credentials, because Gilbert's navel-gazing is not your garden variety navel-gazing, like that of a populist hack, or a self-proclaimed, self-help guru flake-turned scribe. Arguably, \"Eat Pray Love\" should be mentioned in the same breath as Stephen Daldry's \"The Hours\", in addition to its obvious genre classification: the \"chick flick\", and sub-genre: a woman goes on a journey of self-discovery(e.g. Audrey Welles' \"Under the Tuscan Sun\"). Make no mistake about it. Elizabeth Gilbert is a literary writer, albeit not of the same caliber as Virginia Woolf, she is literary within the context of her times; her books belonging to a lesser canon, but a canon of sorts, nevertheless. As played by Julia Roberts, the Pen/Hemingway Award finalist(for her 1997 short story collection \"Pilgrims\") has an ironical spirit about her, when you compare the real-life Gilbert with Ruth Thomas, the sedentary island heroine from the writer's warring lobster fishermen saga \"Stern Men\". The fictional Ruth, in spite of being exposed to boarding school, was content to eat shellfish, and someday marry a man who caught them. Thanks to \"Eat Pray Love\", the reader can't help but psychoanalyze Gilbert through her prior texts. At the time of the 2001 novel's publication, it's only natural to speculate that the then-married writer was trying to justify the institution of marriage, the pros of settling down, since Ruth chooses the island over the world(well, if you consider Maine, the world); or maybe, more accurately, Gilbert was simply revisiting her seventeen-year-old self, back when the younger lass believed in home and family. Both a journalist and a novelist, Gilbert, amidst the other Indians during the film adaptation's strongest chapter, \"Pray\", wears her reporter's hat while lending her ear to a local girl, bemoaning the fast-approaching date of her arranged marriage to a boy she's never met. True to form, objectivist form, Gilbert doesn't share her contemporaneous prejudices against matrimonial unions with the beseeching young woman, a terrified bride-to-be who probably wanted an enlightened opinion, a western opinion, but instead gets a disappointingly stock one. Concerning nuptials, Gilbert, a feminist, as demonstrated through her counter-traditional actions, in effect, lies to the girl, which presents an existential dichotomy of the highest order. On one hand, Gilbert doesn't want to come across like some ugly American, who disregards the sanctity of Hindu law, but still, as the girl's friend and mentor, speaking woman to woman, independent of the cultural divide that separates the east from the west, the older woman owes it to the young girl to consider rebellion. Although Gilbert proves time and time again to be a wonderful human being(\"Eat\" is a lot of fun; Italy, a land of enchantment), she does, in this instance, come across as a hypocrite, but this flaw only makes her more interesting, since all artists live in their own moral universes, with its contradictions and blissful ignorance.",

Gilbert who is in self-discovery by travelling to Italy, India and Bali (no one mentions Indonesia?!) in 2006. Eat at Italy, pray at India and finds love at paradise island Bali. Her book EAT, PRAY, LOVE was on New York Times Best Seller list for 110 weeks. The movie directed by Ryan Murphy who is the Creator of NIP/TUCK, POPULAR and musical phenomenal GLEE. His famous directing credit is RUNNING WITH SCISSORS in 2006. Julia Roberts did her typical Rom-Com Queen role for thousand of time. Three lovers around her Liz character are played by fine Actors such as: Javier Bardem, Billy Crudup, and Spider-Man best friend, James Franco. Bardem brings a relaxing and warm aura into his character. Another brief and believable performance comes from Richard Jenkins as a devastated man in India. There are some surprising performances by Indonesian Actors like: The toothless medicine man, Ketut (played by Hadi Subiyanto), Nyomo (I Gusti Ayu Puspawati), the little Tutti (Anakia Lapae) and senior Actress, Christine Hakim. Subiyanto portrays a memorable and key character, although with limited English. In the half hour at the beginning of thiz chick flick, the plot is kind of boring and flat, but after that we find plenty of funny moments and the story-telling goes better. At the end, I came to the conclusion that Liz Gilbert character was kind of confused and too much worried about herself, she left everything she had for irrational reasons. Thiz movie has been telling us, Each city and person has one word to describe it. Well, my word is: selfishness. One thing is for sure, the real exoticsm of Bali is more beautiful than it appears.

      "text": "This isn't a chick flick, it is about self-discovery, even though that Roberts (which is an odd casting chose) who looks nothing the real Elizabeth Gilbert, Roberts performance is incandescent and does a great job as the character. Co-writer director Ryan Murphy (Running With Scissors) makes this film adaptation artsy and bright also makes the food look like ecstasy, Murphy and his screenwriter Jennifer Salt (Tempo) make this spiritual, relaxed. Writer Elizabeth Gilbert (played Julia Roberts) has reached a life crisis, without her husband Steven (Billy Grudup) realizing it they arrived in different and diverging places in their lives, Liz wants out of their marriage. While Liz and Steven are going their divorce papers, she meets an actor David Piccolo (James Franco) who meet while he's performing a stage play. After meeting him, her biggest problem she realizes is herself, earlier when a Balinese medicine man Ketut (Hadi Subiyanto who is amazing) gave her foretellings. So she maps out her journey. So Liz goes on an adventure to self-discovery first it's Italy where she she learns how to love food again the way she use to love it, then India to learn how to meditate and get some spiritual peace in her life, she meets Richard (Richard Jenkins) they start a friendship. The last part in her self discovery journey is Bolly, where she meets again Ketut to thank him, also give more insights in her life. As she was planning her geographic plan, she meets Felipe (Javier Bardem) they run into each other, they are both divorced they have a few things in common. Things don't go quite as planned. She gets lost by the end of her stay. Despite the Hollywood cliche's and the Hollywood film making, at times this feels like a different movie. Only in this movie in the middle, Jenkins gives his best Oscar performance despite his little screen time. The pacing is great at times a little bit rushed, it's predictable but who cares that's what Gilbert made out to make in her novel at times it's original. The character development is socko, Murphy and Salt successfully put character development in Jenkin's character despite his screen time and so does Bardem who is phenomenal. Grade A",
